# Sapphire Exchange - Progress Summary

## Issues Resolved

1. **Syntax Errors Fixed**: The original `main_window.py` file had systemic corruption that caused persistent syntax errors, particularly with triple-quoted strings. These errors were resolved by creating a new version of the file from scratch.

2. **Variable Naming Consistency**: Fixed the variable naming inconsistency where `user_info` was sometimes used instead of `user_info_widget`.

3. **Application Runs Correctly**: The new version of the file is syntactically correct and runs without errors.

## Features Implemented in New Version

1. Basic UI structure with sidebar and content area
2. Navigation buttons with proper styling
3. User info widget (correctly named)
4. Logout functionality
5. Login completion handler
6. Proper cleanup in closeEvent

## Features Missing from New Version

1. Marketplace functionality
2. My Items page with item listing
3. Create Item functionality
4. Settings page
5. Connection status indicators
6. Message log
7. Activity feed
8. Data quality indicators
9. Seed phrase handling
10. Mock server integration

## Next Steps

1. Gradually add back the missing features
2. Ensure all functionality is properly integrated
3. Test the application thoroughly
4. Polish the UI/UX

## Files Created

1. `main_window_complete_final.py` - The new version of the main window that runs correctly
2. Various intermediate files created during the debugging process

## Conclusion

The critical syntax errors have been resolved and the application now runs. The next phase will focus on restoring the missing features and functionality.
